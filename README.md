# summathy
Summathy is my personal summary of topics from my undergraduate and postgraduate studies of mathematics. It is meant to be self-contained and comprehensive in such a way that it may serve as summary or introduction to mathematics. In contrast to standard textbooks I will only give proofs of important results. However, nothing will be ommitted as I will always sketch how to obtain the result in question.
