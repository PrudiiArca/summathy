# summathy
Summathy is my personal summary of topics from my undergraduate and graduate studies of mathematics. It is meant to be self-contained and comprehensive in such a way that it may serve as summary or introduction to mathematics. In contrast to standard textbooks I will always sketch how to obtain the result in question, while only proofs of important results may be given.
